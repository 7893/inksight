# Inksight Project Goals

## Core Objective
Transform chaotic email inbox into an intelligent, structured personal data warehouse with natural language interaction capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Email Processing
- Automatic classification into 5 categories (newsletter, financial, travel, personal, spam)
- Entity extraction from emails (merchants, amounts, dates, destinations)
- Multimodal support (text, PDF, images)

### 2. Structured Data Storage
- Financial transactions tracking
- Travel bookings management
- Newsletter content summarization
- Personal correspondence archiving

### 3. Semantic Search & RAG
- Vector-based semantic search across all emails
- Natural language queries: "show me coffee expenses last month"
- Context-aware smart reply generation

### 4. Security & Privacy
- Passwordless authentication (WebAuthn/FIDO2)
- Envelope encryption for credentials
- Multi-tenant row-level security
- Zero-trust architecture

### 5. Generative UI
- E-ink inspired minimalist design
- Dynamic chart generation from queries
- Natural language command interface
- Human-in-the-loop feedback system

### 6. Automation & Integration
- Daily morning brief generation
- Smart reply suggestions
- Webhook integrations with external services
- Telegram/WeChat notifications

## Technical Principles

- **Serverless-first:** Cloudflare Workers for compute
- **Event-driven:** Async processing pipeline
- **Multi-modal storage:** D1 + R2 + Vectorize
- **AI-powered:** Workers AI for classification and extraction
- **Security-first:** Zero-trust, encrypted credentials
- **Scalable:** Multi-tenant from day one

## Success Metrics

- Email processing latency < 5 seconds
- Classification accuracy > 95%
- Entity extraction precision > 90%
- Query response time < 500ms
- Zero credential leaks
- 100% data isolation between users

## Non-Goals

- Not a full email client (no composition UI)
- Not a replacement for primary mailbox
- Not a spam filter (classification only)
- Not a backup service (R2 is cache, not archive)

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile app with push notifications
- Voice command interface
- Predictive insights (spending patterns, travel trends)
- Multi-mailbox aggregation
- Calendar integration
- Contact relationship mapping
